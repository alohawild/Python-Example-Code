Python-Example-Code
===================

Writing some basic Python examples for a friend to learn Python. Enjoy!

This is just a collection of some example Python code I was writing for a friend to learn Python.

My last time in Python was in the 1990s so I am not the best coder to copy from.

The code has no licence as this is just well "code droppings" and may be copied and taken and done with.
